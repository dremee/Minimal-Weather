It is  a simple clone of original ios weather application. 
I chose to use https://openweathermap.org api. I had several limitations In its free version, but, in general, i had enough for demonstration my skills.

First of all, it's my first full project. In past, i was just learning with books and online course (udemy, udacity). I made small apps, but most of them were very simple and had one target - to understant local technology. 

I started from an easy tasks, just created a simple viewcontroller, that performed current location data. 
Next, i decided that app needs more functionality and created Main View Controller. This VC can keep List of cities and display detail information for user. 
I made "save data" functionality with FileManager, that was enought, because it was an easy app.
